#' FuseSOM: FuseSOM provides a pipeline for the clustering of highly
#' multiplexed in situ imaging cytometry assays. This pipeline uses
#' the Self Organizing Map architecture coupled with Multiview hierarchical
#' clustering. We also provide functions for normalisation and estimation
#' of the number of clusters.
