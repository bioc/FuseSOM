Description: A correlation based multiview self organizing map for the characterization of cell types in IMC data. 
    (`FuseSOM`) is a tool for unsupervised clustering of IMC data. `FuseSOM` is robust and achieves high accuracy by combining a 
    `Self Organizing Map` architecture and a `Multiview` integration of correlation based metrics to cluster IMC data. 
    The `FuseSOM` pipeline has been streamlined and accepts currently used data structures including 
    `SingleCellExperiment` and `SpatialExperiment` objects as well as `DataFrames`.
